# `parzec` - Parser Combinators for Typescript

Parzec is a parser combinator library inspired by [Parsec][]. A parser 
combinator library is basically a set of [higher order functions][] which make 
it easy to build [recursive descent parsers][]. Parsers composed from Parzec's 
combinators can recognize languages in the [PEG][] class of grammars. PEG 
grammars can be context-sensitive, so the parsers have infinite lookahead and 
backtracking capabilities. 

Parzec also supports efficient parsing of [LL(1)][] grammars by enabling the 
backtracking only when a special combinator is used. Also, to improve 
performance, some combinators have been inlined rather than built from lower 
level combinators.

Parzec's input is represented by an abstract [interface][]. Consequently, the 
parsers' input can be anything from simple strings to files, or even tokenized 
data streams. Parzec includes functionality to create [lexical analyzers][] or 
_lexers_ from [regular expressions][]. The lexer converts input strings into 
tokens, and makes the parsing simpler and more efficient.
